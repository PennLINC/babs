About
---------
BIDS App Bootstrap (BABS) is a reproducible, generalizable, and
scalable Python package for BIDS App analysis of large datasets.
It uses `DataLad <https://www.datalad.org/>`_ and adopts
the `FAIRly big framework <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01163-2>`_.
Currently it is compatible with SGE and Slurm clusters.

..  If using relative path, e.g., `_static/babs_cli.png`, although readthedocs front page would look good, GitHub front page cannot find that image!!!
