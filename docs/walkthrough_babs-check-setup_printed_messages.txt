Submitting a test job, will take a while to finish...
Although the script will be submitted to the cluster to run, this job will not run the BIDS App; instead, this test job will gather setup information in the designated environment and will make sure jobs can finish successfully on current cluster.
Test job has been submitted (job ID: 4635991).
