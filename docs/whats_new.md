## Version 0.2.0

### What's Changed

This release is the result of a major refactor of the codebase. The most important changes are that
`babs` is a standalone command and the `babs-*` commands are now subcommands of `babs`. Please
switch and scripts that use `babs-<command>` to use `babs <command>` instead. There are also
a number of arguments that have been renamed and/or removed. Please refer to the `--help` output
for the latest information.

The config yaml format has also changed. See examples of valid configurations in the `notebooks`
directory.
