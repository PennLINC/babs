Example walkthrough
**********************

In this example walkthrough, we will use toy BIDS data and toy BIDS App
to demonstrate how to use BABS.

By following the :doc:`the installation page <installation>`, 
you should have successfully installed BABS and its dependent software
(``DataLad``, ``Git``, ``git-annex``, ``datalad-container``)
in a conda environment called ``babs``. In addition, because the toy BIDS data
we'll use is on OSF, you also need to install ``datalad-osf``.
