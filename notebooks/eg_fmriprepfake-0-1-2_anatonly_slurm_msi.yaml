# This is an example config yaml file for:
#   BIDS App:         fmriprep-fake
#   BIDS App version: 0.1.2
#   Task:             `--anat-only` mode
#   Which system:     Slurm
#   Tested on which cluster:  UMN MSI cluster

# Warning!!!
#   although `fmriprep-fake` version 0.1.2 takes argument `--anat-only`, it won't do anything different,
#   and it will still generate all derivatives (including fMRI data derivatives)...
#   Therefore, this is only for testing purpose!

# Warning!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!

# Arguments in `singularity run`:
singularity_run:
    --anat-only: ""

# Output foldername(s) to be zipped, and the BIDS App version to be included in the zip filename(s):
#   As we are using BIDS output layout, we need to ask BABS to create a folder 'fmriprep_anat' to wrap all derivatives:
zip_foldernames:
    $TO_CREATE_FOLDER: "true"
    fmriprep_anat: "0-1-2"   # folder 'fmriprep_anat' will be zipped into 'sub-xx_(ses-yy_)fmriprep_anat-0-1-2.zip'

# How much cluster resources it needs:
cluster_resources:
    interpreting_shell: "/bin/bash -l"
    hard_memory_limit: 2G
    temporary_disk_space: 20G
    hard_runtime_limit: "20"   # 20min
    customized_text: |
        #SBATCH -p amd2tb,ram256g
# Notes: Above `customized_text` is MSI Slurm cluster specific.
#   So it may not be relevant for other clusters

# Necessary commands to be run first:
script_preamble: |
    source /home/faird/shared/code/external/envs/miniconda3/load_miniconda3.sh   # [FIX ME] MSI cluster faird group. Replace filepath with yours.
    conda activate babs   # [FIX ME] replace 'babs' with your env variable name

# Where to run the jobs:
job_compute_space: "/tmp"   # [FIX ME] MSI cluster

# Below is to filter out subjects (or sessions). Only those with required files will be kept.
#   Because of `--anat-only`, func bold data is not needed.
required_files:
    $INPUT_DATASET_#1:
        - "anat/*_T1w.nii*"

# 'alert_log_messages': not included in this example, but you may add it!
