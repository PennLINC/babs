# This is an example config yaml file for:
#   BIDS App:         toy BIDS App "toy_bids_app"
#   BIDS App version: 0.0.7
#   Task:             `--zipped`, for application to zipped BIDS derivatives dataset
#   Which system:     Slurm
#   Tested on which cluster:  UMN MSI cluster

# Warning!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!

# Arguments in `singularity run`:
singularity_run:
    --zipped: ""    # for zipped input dataset
    --dummy: "2"   # this is a dummy variable, accepting values
    -v: ""    # this is also a dummy variable, not accepting values

# Output foldername(s) to be zipped, and the BIDS App version to be included in the zip filename(s):
zip_foldernames:
    toybidsapp: "0-0-7"   # folder 'toybidsapp' will be zipped into 'sub-xx_(ses-yy_)toybidsapp-0-0-7.zip'

cluster_resources:
    interpreting_shell: "/bin/bash -l"
    hard_memory_limit: 25G
    temporary_disk_space: 50G
    hard_runtime_limit: "20"   # 20min
    customized_text: |
        #SBATCH -p amd2tb,ram256g
# Notes: Above `customized_text` is MSI Slurm cluster specific.
#   So it may not be relevant for other clusters

# Necessary commands to be run first:
script_preamble: |
    source /home/faird/shared/code/external/envs/miniconda3/load_miniconda3.sh   # [FIX ME] MSI cluster faird group. Replace filepath with yours.
    conda activate babs   # [FIX ME] replace 'babs' with your env variable name

# Where to run the jobs:
job_compute_space: "/tmp"   # [FIX ME] MSI cluster

# 'required_files' section is not needed for toy BIDS App.

# 'alert_log_messages' section is usually not needed for toy BIDS App.
