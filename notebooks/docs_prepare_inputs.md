This docs show how to prepare inputs following BABS's requirements.

# Input dataset(s)
## If single-ses
* if zipped, must follow the pattern of `sub-*_<name>*.zip`, where `<name>` is the name of this input dataset.
    * there should not be `ses-*` in this zip filename.
    * all zip filename must follow the same pattern, i.e., the characters between `<name>` and `.zip` must be consistent across all zip files.
