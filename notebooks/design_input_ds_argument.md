Different scenarios:

| zipped? raw BIDS?      | only one input dataset | 2 or more input datasets    |
| :---                  |    :----             |          ---: |
| __raw BIDS, unzipped__      | e.g., fMRIPrep, QSIPrep       | Here's this   |
| __BIDS derivatives, zipped__   | Text        | And more      |

| Instances     | 1st input dataset | 2nd input datasets    |
| :---:                  |    :----:             |         :---: |
| fMRIPrep     | raw BIDS, unzipped       | -   |
| QSIPrep   | raw BIDS, unzipped        | -      |
| XCP-D   | BIDS derivatives, zipped <br> (as positional argu `fmri_dir`)        | -      |
| Steinhardt <br> (run fMRIPrep with FS done before)   | raw BIDS, unzipped <br> (as positional argu `bids_dir`)        | BIDS derivatives, zipped <br> (as named argu `--fs-subjects-dir`)     |


What we need to know re: `XCP-D`:
# as there is only 1 input dataset, it will be cloned to `inputs/data`
* 1st input dataset:
  * give it a name: `fmriprep_outputs`  # optional if only one input dataset; this won't be used;
  * it's zipped, so we need extra info:
  * zipped foldername suffix --> we add prefix of `${subid}_${sesid}` and generate `${subid}_${sesid}_fmriprep-20.2.3.zip`? what if this input dataset was not generated by our TheWay protocol? Force the users to follow this rule?
  * in this zipped folder, after unzipping, what's the relative path to the data as input? `fmriprep`
  * where does this input data go? positional argu, or named argu?
    * If it's named argu, probably another placeholder in `babs_singularity_run`, e.g. `$INPUT_DATASET_#2`

What we need to know re: Steinhardt:
# as there will be >1 input dataset, they will be cloned to `inputs/data/<name user gives>`
* 1st input dataset:
  * give it a name: `BIDS`  # required, as >1 input dataset; the input dataset will be cloned to `inputs/data/BIDS`
  * it's raw BIDS dataset
  * used as positional argu
* 2nd input dataset:
  * give it a name: `freesurfer`
  * it's zipped,
  * zipped foldername suffix = `freesurfer-0-0-0` --> we change to `${subid}_${sesid}_freesurfer-0-0-0.zip`
  * in this zipped folder, after unzipping, what's the relative path to the data as input? `freesurfer` --> this means that the path in babs is `inputs/data/freesurfer/freesurfer`   # first `freesurfer` is from the name user gives;
  * used as named argu - also update `babs_singularity_run`
