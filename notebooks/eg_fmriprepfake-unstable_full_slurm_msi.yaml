# This is an example config yaml file for fmriprep-fake version 'unstable'.
# fmriprep-fake's Docker image is publicly available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/djarecka/fmriprep_fake
  # However, the version we use here is available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/chenyingzhao/fmriprep_fake
# fmriprep-fake generates fMRIPrep outputs without running fMRIPrep itself. You may use it to check fmriprep outputs.
#     More details please see: https://github.com/djarecka/fmriprep-fake
# Thanks to Dorota Jarecka for preparing and sharing this BIDS App!
