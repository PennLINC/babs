#   BIDS App:         XCP-D ("xcpd")
#   BIDS App version: 0.4.0
#   Task:             Running the entire workflow, for NIfTI images (i.e., without `--cifti`)
#   Which system:     SGE or Slurm

# WARNING!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!
