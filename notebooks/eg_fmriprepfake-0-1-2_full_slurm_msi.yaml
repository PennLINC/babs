# This is an example config yaml file for:
#   BIDS App:         fmriprep-fake
#   BIDS App version: 0.1.2
#   Task:             regular mode, generating BIDS output layout
#   Which system:     Slurm
#   Tested on which cluster:  UMN MSI cluster

# Warning!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!

# 'singularity_run': There is no such section for fmriprep-fake
#   as all commands needed by fmriprep-fake have been handled by BABS.

# Output foldername(s) to be zipped, and the BIDS App version to be included in the zip filename(s):
#   As we are using BIDS output layout, we need to ask BABS to create a folder 'fmriprepfake' to wrap all derivatives:
zip_foldernames:
    $TO_CREATE_FOLDER: "true"
    fmriprepfake: "0-1-2"   # folder 'fmriprepfake' will be zipped into 'sub-xx_ses-yy_fmriprepfake-0-1-2.zip'
