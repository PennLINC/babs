# This is an example config yaml file for fmriprep-fake version 'unstable'.
# fmriprep-fake's Docker image is publicly available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/djarecka/fmriprep_fake
  # However, the version we use here is available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/chenyingzhao/fmriprep_fake
# fmriprep-fake generates fMRIPrep outputs without running fMRIPrep itself. You may use it to check fmriprep outputs.
#     More details please see: https://github.com/djarecka/fmriprep-fake
# Thanks to Dorota Jarecka for preparing and sharing this BIDS App!

# Warning!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the toy BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!

# Arguments in `singularity run`:
singularity_run:
    --output-layout: "legacy"

# Output foldername(s) to be zipped, and the BIDS App version to be included in the zip filename(s):
#   For `--output-layout legacy`, users don't need to create the output folder,
#   as all derivatives are in 'fmriprep' or 'freesurfer' folder.
zip_foldernames:
    fmriprep: "0-1-2"   # folder 'fmriprep' will be zipped into 'sub-xx_ses-yy_fmriprep-0-1-2.zip'
    freesurfer: '0-1-2'   # folder 'freesurfer' will be zipped into 'sub-xx_ses-yy_freesurfer-0-1-2.zip'
