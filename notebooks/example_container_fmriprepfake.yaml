# This is an example config yaml file for fmriprep-fake version 0.1.0.
# fmriprep-fake's Docker image is publicly available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/djarecka/fmriprep_fake
# fmriprep-fake generates fMRIPrep outputs without running fMRIPrep itself. You may use it to check fmriprep outputs.
#     More details please see: https://github.com/djarecka/fmriprep-fake
# Thanks to Dorota Jarecka for preparing and sharing this BIDS App!

# Warning!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the toy BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!
