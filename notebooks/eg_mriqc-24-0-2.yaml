# This is an example config yaml file for:
#   BIDS App:         MRIQC ("mriqc")
#   BIDS App version: 24-0-2
#   Task:             regular use
#   Which system:     SGE or Slurm

# WARNING!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!

# Arguments in `singularity run`:
bids_app_args:
    $SUBJECT_SELECTION_FLAG: "--participant-label"
    -w: "$BABS_TMPDIR" # this is a placeholder recognized by BABS.
    --n_cpus: "4"

# Arguments that are passed directly to singularity/apptainer:
singularity_args:
    - --containall
    - --writable-tmpfs

# Output foldername(s) to be zipped, and the BIDS App version to be included in the zip filename(s):
#   As MRIQC will use BIDS output layout, we need to ask BABS to create a folder 'mriqc' to wrap all derivatives:

zip_foldernames:
    mriqc: "24-0-2" # folder 'mriqc' will be zipped into 'sub-xx_(ses-yy_)mriqc-24-0-2.zip'

# How much cluster resources it needs:
cluster_resources:
    interpreting_shell: "/bin/bash"
    hard_runtime_limit: "6:00:00"
    temporary_disk_space: 100G
