# This is an example config yaml file for:
#   BIDS App:         toy BIDS App "toy_bids_app"
#   BIDS App version: 0.0.7
#   Task:             `--zipped`, for application to zipped BIDS derivatives dataset
#   Which system:     SGE or Slurm

# Warning!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!

# Arguments in `singularity run`:
bids_app_args:
    $SUBJECT_SELECTION_FLAG: "--participant-label"
    --zipped: "" # for zipped input dataset
    --dummy: "2" # this is a dummy variable, accepting values
    -v: "" # this is also a dummy variable, not accepting values

# Arguments that are passed directly to singularity/apptainer:
singularity_args:
    - --containall
    - --writable-tmpfs
    - -B /path/to/recon_spec.yaml:/code/recon_spec.yaml

# Output foldername(s) to be zipped, and the BIDS App version to be included in the zip filename(s):
zip_foldernames:
    toybidsapp: "0-0-7" # folder 'toybidsapp' will be zipped into 'sub-xx_(ses-yy_)toybidsapp-0-0-7.zip'

cluster_resources:
    interpreting_shell: "/bin/bash"
    hard_memory_limit: 25G
    temporary_disk_space: 50G
    hard_runtime_limit: "00:20:00" # 20min

# Necessary commands to be run first:
#   [FIX ME] change or add commands for setting up the virtual environment, for loading necessary modules, etc
script_preamble: |
    source xxxx    # [FIX ME or DELETE ME] source any necessary program
    conda activate my_conda_env_name   # [FIX ME] replace 'my_conda_env_name' with your environment variable name

# Where to run the jobs:
job_compute_space: "/path/to/temporary_compute_space" # [FIX ME] replace "/path/to/temporary_compute_space" with yours

# 'required_files' section is not needed for toy BIDS App.

# 'alert_log_messages' section is usually not needed for toy BIDS App.
