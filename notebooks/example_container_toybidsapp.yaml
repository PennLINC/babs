# This is an example config yaml file for:
#   toy BIDS App "toy_bids_app"
#   whose version = 0.0.7
#   for application to raw BIDS dataset ("unzipped")
# Toy BIDS App's Docker image is publicly available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/pennlinc/toy_bids_app
# This BIDS App counts number of non-hidden files in a subject's (or a session's) folder;
#     More details please see: https://github.com/PennLINC/babs_tests/blob/main/docker/README.md#toy-bids-app-toy_bids_app
# How to prepare a container DataLad dataset of this toy BIDS App? See docs here: https://pennlinc-babs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preparation_container.html

# Warning!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the toy BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!
