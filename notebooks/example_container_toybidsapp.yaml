# This is an example config yaml file for toy BIDS App "toybidsapp" version 0.0.5.
# Toy BIDS App can be pulled from: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/chenyingzhao/toy_bids_app/general
# ^^ TODO: move this docker image to PennLINC!
  # This BIDS App counts number of non-hidden files in a subject's folder;
  # As it does not support `--bids-filter-file`, for multi-session data,
  # it will still count files in a subject's, but not a session's folder.

# Warning!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the toy BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!
