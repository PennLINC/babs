# This is an example config yaml file for:
#   BIDS App:         QSIPrep ("qsiprep")
#   BIDS App version: 0.18.1
#   Task:             `--sloppy` mode
#   Which system:     SGE
#   Tested on which cluster:  Penn Med CUBIC cluster

# WARNING!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!
# WARNING!!!
#   We'll use `--sloppy` testing mode of QSIPrep.
#   Therefore this YAML file should only be used for testing purpose.
#   You should NOT use this YAML file to generate formal results!
