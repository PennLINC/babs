# This is an example config yaml file for:
#   BIDS App:         fMRIPrep ("fmriprep")
#   BIDS App version: 23.1.3
#   Task:             `--anat-only` mode
#   Which system:     SGE
#   Tested on which cluster:  PennMed CUBIC cluster

# WARNING!!!
#   This is only an example, which may not necessarily fit your purpose,
#   or be an optimized solution for your case,
#   or be compatible to the BIDS App version you're using.
#   Therefore, please change and tailor it for your case before use it!!!

# Arguments in `singularity run`:
singularity_run:
    -w: "$BABS_TMPDIR"   # this is a placeholder recognized by BABS.
    --n_cpus: "1"
    --stop-on-first-crash: ""
    --fs-license-file: "/cbica/projects/BABS/software/FreeSurfer/license.txt"  # [FIX ME] path to FS license file

    --force-bbr: ""   # TODO: needed?
    -v: '-v'
    --anat-only: ""   # only runs the anatomical workflows

# Output foldername(s) to be zipped, and the BIDS App version to be included in the zip filename(s):
#   As fMRIPrep will use BIDS output layout, we need to ask BABS to create a folder 'fmriprep_anat' to wrap all derivatives:
zip_foldernames:
    $TO_CREATE_FOLDER: "true"
    fmriprep_anat: "23-1-3"   # folder 'fmriprep_anat' will be zipped into 'sub-xx_(ses-yy_)fmriprep_anat-23-1-3.zip'
# Note: The generated data can also be used to provide FreeSurfer derivatives as input dataset when running fMRIPrep on fMRI data,
#   i.e., for use case: fMRIPrep with FreeSurfer results ingressed.
#   For that case, when using `babs-init`, for `--input`, please call this FreeSurfer derivatives dataset 'fmriprep_anat'.
